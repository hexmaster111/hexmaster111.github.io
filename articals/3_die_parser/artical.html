<h1>Die Parser</h1>

<p>
    In this article, Describe how the ParseDie method below works.


    This method is designed to take an input string, and return back a die roll structure.
</p>


<p>

<pre><code class="language-c">
typedef struct Die
{
    int amount, sides, offset;
} Die;
</code></pre>

<p>
    The overall goal of this method is to turn the string "1d12+1" into a Die object with the values

<pre>
{
    int amount = 1;
    int sides = 12;
    int offset = 1;
}
</pre>

</p>


<pre><code class="language-c">

void ParseDie(const char *str, Die *out)
{
    char pb[10] = {0};
    const char *c = str;
    const char *sb = NULL;
    while (*c != 0 && *c != 'd')
        c++;

    memcpy(pb, str, c - str);
    out->amount = atoi(pb);
    memset(pb, 0, sizeof(pb));

    c += 1; // skip the d
    sb = c;

    while (*c != 0 && *c != '+' && *c != '-')
        c++;

    memcpy(pb, sb, c - sb);
    out->sides = atoi(pb);
    memset(pb, 0, sizeof(pb));

    sb = c;

    while (*c != 0)
        c++;

    memcpy(pb, sb, c - sb);
    out->offset = atoi(pb);
}
    </code></pre>


The first magic thing we see,
<pre><code class="language-c">
        while (*c != 0 && *c != 'd')
            c++;
</code></pre>

Lets break this down.

Firstly, we have a char pointer called <code>c</code> this pointer can be thought of like
the cursor, its where in the string we are.
<br>

In this while loop, we take the value at c, represented by
<code>*c</code>, we then check that it is not zero.

<pre><code class="language-c">*c != 0</code></pre>

If the string is 0 at this point, we have hit the end of the string and should not continue. <br>
For those who do not know, a c string ALWAYS ends with a null char. This rule is fallowed by all of the standard library
functions.
<br>

Now we verified that we are not at the end of the string.
Next up, we check for the first break condition, when the value at c (*c) becomes the letter <code>d</code>
(
<pre><code class="language-c">*c != 'd'</code></pre>)
we know that we have found all the characters that make up the amount of die to roll. When we do not hit
any of these conditions, we increment the cursor position by one, and move on to checking the next char.
<p>Thinking about it, when you read *c in your mind, i want you to think, The value at c</p>
<br>

In the code now, we have two pointers; <code>str</code>, and <code>c</code>. c is a pointer to the end of
the first number we are parsing.

<br>
The next step is to turn this pointer into the number that its chars represent. Currently this string is in ASCII,
and we want it to just be a plane old number that we can work with later. Todo this, we will use another stdlib method,
<code>int atoi(char *)</code> atoi takes in a pointer of a null terminated string, and returns the number it represents.
We cant just pass in our current pointer, as it would start reading into the other parts of the string, and the man
pages do not tell us, what the return is when there is a non-number character in the buffer, so to avoid undefined
behaver, we will make a new buffer <code>pb</code> that we can modify and append the null terminator into.

The C magic todo that looks like this:
<pre><code class="language-c">memcpy(pb, str, c - str)</code></pre>

We use a function out of <code>string.h</code> memcpy. Memory Copy takes in a destination pointer, a source pointer,
and the amount of bytes to copy. For the destination, we pass in the address of <code>pb</code>, for a source,
we use <code>str</code>, the input string, seeing as the start of our number is always the first char in the string.

With a little pointer subtraction, we can compute the length of the first number.
<pre>
str v         - Str points to this first byte of the string
    1d12+0
c    ^        - cp points to the char d
</pre>

In this case, we can visually see that <code>c</code> is one in front of str. And as such, <code>c - str = 1</code>.
This gives us our length to pass into Memory Copy.
<br>
On with the next show of magic; the atoi call.
<pre><code class="language-c">out->amount = atoi(pb)</code></pre>
We take our char array that we just copied our string into, and pass that to atoi to turn it into a nice number for us.
Ascii to Int is usually considered an untasteful method to use, as there is no way to tell if it failed. When atoi
fails, it returns the number 0... A perfectly valid number, with no way to check for errors. In our case, the user
will see that there is a zero in there dice rolling UI, so I don't worry about it here. But it is something to
think about if you are doing something like this in production.
<br>
If you are not used to pointers in c, we have to use the arrow syntax,
this means dereference the pointer. So we end up writing to the struct that is defined in the method that called us.
Then we have to reset our parse buffer for the next number that we have to parse, lucky the string.h has something
for that too! Its called <code>memset(void* dst, c, len)</code>. Memory Set takes in a pointer to
the destination to set values to, a number that we want to set each byte to, and the length of data we want to set
from the dst pointer. For us, we use a call like this
<pre><code class="language-c">memset(pb, 0, sizeof(pb))</code></pre>.

We pass for length of the pb pointer, the <code>sizeof(pb)</code>, and sizeof returns the length of the object in bytes,
so we don't have todo any math on its value, as we are working with bytes directly.
After this call, our <code>pb</code> array is now all zeros, all reset and ready for us to use it once more!
<br>
<br>
Next, we skip the d char that the user provided us. This is done by incrementing the c pointer by 1.
<code>c += 1</code>
<br>

We then store the current cursor into our variable called <code>sb</code>, as we are going to need to use
where we are now to compute how far in the string we have gone.
<br>

We use a smiler while loop to skip to the next separator in our string, a + or -, this works exactly the same 
as above, just with different constants as our break conditions. So I wont bore you that part ðŸ˜€.

What is different, is how we compute the offsets for our die sides number, this requires us to use the <code>sb</code>
pointer that we stored before. This time we cant use str as our base to pass into memcpy, here is why :
<pre>
    str v         - Str points to this first byte of the string
        1d12+0
    sb    ^ ^     - sb points to the char after the d
     c      |     - c now points to the char +
    </pre>

    We can now employ simler memcpy, atoi, and setting calls,

    <pre><code class="language-c">
memcpy(pb, sb, c - sb);
out->sides = atoi(pb);
memset(pb, 0, sizeof(pb));
    </code></pre>

    We are on the final step now! We just need to read out the offset that we want to apply to the roll, this 
    can be positive or negative, so lucky for us, cursor <code>c</code> is already pointing at the + or - symbol 
    for us. So lets save that into <code>sb</code> for the same use with memcpy. 
    <pre><code>sb = c;</code></pre> Easy! and now we just want to read to the end of the string, this one is 
    easer too, as we already that the string ends with a null byte (0). 
    <pre><code class="language-c">
while (*c != 0) c++;</code></pre>

Perfect, now our pointers are going to look like this,
<pre>
    str v         - Str points to this first byte of the string
        1d12+0
    sb      ^ ^   - sb points to the + char
     c        |   - c now points to final null byte
    </pre>

and now we copy it out to our parse buffer and atoi it the same as we did before, 

<pre><code>
memcpy(pb, sb, c - sb);
out->offset = atoi(pb);</code></pre>

</p>

after this, our method returns, and we are done. We have read in that die roll from its corresponding string!

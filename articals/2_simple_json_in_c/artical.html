<h1>Simple JSON building in C</h1>

<p>Sometimes, we just want to put a JSON string together. I came up with what I think to be a novel solution to this
    problem.</p>


<pre><code class="language-c">
#define JSON_IMPL
#include "json_simple.h"

// just a buffer to write into 
char buf[1024*3] = {0};

JsonBuildObject_Start(buf);
    JsonBuildObject_AddPropertyRaw(buf, "k", "1", 0);
    JsonBuildObject_AddProperty(buf, "label", "Label", 0);
    JsonBuildObject_AddProperty(buf, "something", "123", 0);
    JsonBuildObject_AddPropertyRaw(buf, "obj", "{}", 0);
    JsonBuildObject_AddPropertyRaw(buf, "arr", "[]", 1);
JsonBuildObject_End(buf);

printf("%s\n", buf);
</code></pre>


<p>
    From this little sample, you can already start to see the power of this tool! But this simple sample glosses over a
    few of the more powerful features that this header file can provide. For example, where we add the
    hardcoded object `{}`, this can be replaced with another `JsonBuildObject_Start()` group.


<pre><code class="language-c">
    char obj_a_buf[1024] = {0};
    char obj_b_buf[1024] = {0};

    JsonBuildObject_Start(obj_b_buf);
        JsonBuildObject_AddPropertyRaw(obj_b_buf, "arr", "[0,1,2,3,4]", 1);
    JsonBuildObject_End(obj_b_buf);

    JsonBuildObject_Start(obj_a_buf);
        JsonBuildObject_AddPropertyRaw(obj_a_buf, "k", "1", 0);
        JsonBuildObject_AddPropertyRaw(obj_a_buf, "obj", obj_b_buf, 0);
        JsonBuildObject_AddPropertyRaw(obj_a_buf, "arr", "[]", 1);
    JsonBuildObject_End(obj_a_buf);

    printf("%s\n", obj_a_buf);
        </code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-json">{"k":1,"obj":{"arr":[0,1,2,3,4]},"arr":[]}</code></pre>

Looking at this, And thinking about it, I think we could make it easer to work with still from nested loops, Right now,
You have to have each object built already before running the outer object.

I think this is actually pretty silly. So I think I will add another API method. Something like
<code class="language-c">JsonBuildObject_StartInnerObject()</code>
and
<code class="language-c">JsonBuildObject_EndInnerObject()</code>
This will allow us to not need to start off
with a pre built object in another buffer.

<pre><code class="language-c">
    char buf[1024] = {0};
    JsonBuildObject_Start(buf);
        JsonBuildObject_AddPropertyRaw(buf, "k", "1", 0);
            JsonBuildObject_StartObject(buf, "Object");
                JsonBuildObject_AddPropertyRaw(buf, "o", "123", 1);
            JsonBuildObject_EndObject(buf, 0);
        JsonBuildObject_AddPropertyRaw(buf, "arr", "[]", 1);
    JsonBuildObject_End(buf);
</code></pre>

With those little changes, it is far easer to work with json now!

<h2>How this works?</h2>

<p>Well... Ive been using C# and a lot of the inbuilt json tools and they all just feel... bloated with runtime
    reflection
    and a need for attributes and all sorts of stuff that yes, makes sense if you stair at it long enough, but
    I wanted something simpler.

    I just want to make a little json object with a few properties to blast off to a web server, or to write to a
    text file to read later. So I made something simple, DEAD simple.</p>


<p>Lets look at this one call at a time!</p>
<p>
    Our first call is that of JsonBuildObject_Start(char * dst). This call is very simple, it just
    appends the json's '{' to start the object at the end of the buffer.


    Here is the body of that method for reference.
<pre><code class="language-c"> dst[strlen(dst)] = '{'</code></pre>

First thing we do, is measure the current string length (a common theme though this process).
we then insert the Open bracket at the measured position.

In the first call here <code>strlen()</code> will return 0, as the buffer is filled with all 0's and there is no length
to the string inside!
</p>

<p>
    Onto the next call, <code>JsonBuildObject_AddPropertyRaw(buf, "k", "1", 0)</code>

    The goal of this call is to add an property to the json, k, and set its value to the number 1.

    To solve this, lets look at the current state of the buffer

<pre>
        buf[0] = '{'
        buf[1] = 0
        buf[2] = 0's...
    </pre>

To add a property we want to append a quote, and then copy in the name of the object.

We can accomplish this work in C using the <code>memcpy(void *dst, void *src, size_t len)</code> function.

memcpy or Memory Copy, takes in an address to copy data to, and an address to copy data from, along with a length
to copy argument.

firstly to make the property, lets append the quote. This is done the same way we append the open bracket in the
last step.

Then, we measure the distance in that we should start copying. Todo this we use strlen once more.
<pre><code class="language-c">int inspos = strlen(dst);</code></pre>

Now that we know where we should place the property name, we can compute the offset in the buffer, while this sounds 
complex, its simply addition!
Lets look at that memcpy call closer!
<pre><code class="language-c">memcpy(dst + inspos, name, strlen(name))</code></pre>

Here, we have our dest pointer, its a pointer to the buffer we described above,
<pre>
    buf[0] = '{'
    buf[1] = '"'
    buf[2] = 0
    buf[3] = 0
    buf[4] = 0
    buf[5] = 0
    buf[6] = 0's...
</pre>

    So now, <code>inpos</code> is equal to 2, as its the next spot to insert into the buffer.

    Now we are in C, so we can just do math on the pointer directly! if we add 2 to the buffer pointer,
    we end up with a buffer that looks like this to the memcpy function. 

    <pre>
        buf[0] = 0         
        buf[1] = 0
        buf[2] = 0
        buf[3] = 0
        buf[4] = 0's...
    </pre>

    It looks empty! but its not, we just scooted the buffer forwards! or in other words, we offset our buffer.

    We now go into the memcpy call, where the name gets placed into our buffer at buffer + 2.

    Lets look at our buffer now.

    <pre>
    buf[0] = '{'
    buf[1] = '"'
    buf[2] = 'k'
    buf[3] = 0
    buf[4] = 0
    buf[5] = 0
    buf[6] = 0's...
    </pre>

    Perfect, memcpy put the name of the property we are copying into the buffer. Now we can append the next quote
    like we did before, measuring the string with strlen, and then inserting at that position; We do the same for
    the prop name, value separator char ':'.

    Next we need to copy in the value of this property, and its done in an identical fashion as we copied
    in the name of this property. 

    After all this copying, lets look at the state of our buffer now.

    
    <pre>
        buf[0] = '{'
        buf[1] = '"'
        buf[2] = 'k'
        buf[3] = '"'
        buf[4] = ':'
        buf[5] = '1'
        buf[6] = 0's...
    </pre>

    This looks great, except its missing something to be done with this call, the `,` char, to denote that
    there are more properties and values to come! To handle this, I have the <code>isLast</code> argument, that
    is set to 1 if its the last property, and set to a 0 if its is not. <br>

    In this case, we arn't done building this object so there is a very little if statement we use

    <pre><code class="language-c">if (!isLast) dst[strlen(dst)] = ','</code></pre>

    this just checks weather this is the last one, if its not the last property, we append a <code>,</code> to the end
    of the buffer!

    Then the method returns.
</p>

<p>
    The next call, <code>JsonBuildObject_StartObject(char *dst, char *name)</code> takes in 
    two pointers, one to where to write our data to, and the name of the object we are starting.
    <br>
    Just like the last step, we append a <code>"</code> to the buffer, and then copy in the name.

    This leaves our final buffer as fallows <br>

    <pre><code class="language-json">{"k":1,"Object":{</code></pre>

        This leaves our buffer in the perfect state to start using any of the add property methods,
        or even an add object call. This can be tied together with for loops to make a very powerful
        serialization system with nothing more then a buffer!
</p>

<p>
    Lets skip on to where we are starting to finish up this work, now that we have an object here. 
    Firstly, we must think of the builder like a stack, we called _start and  like methods, 
    so we will have to call there corresponding _end methods. We just got done with the "Object", 
    so lets call <code>JsonBuildObject_EndObject(buf, 1)</code> to stop appending to that object.
    
    The buffer simply gets a <code>}</code> appended to it, as we passed a one to the method, indicating that 
    this is property in the object, so we don't need to put a coma in.

    the buffer is now in this state:
    <pre><code class="language-json">{"k":1,"Object":{}</code></pre>
    Perfect! Now all we have todo is call 
    <code>JsonBuildObject_End(buf);</code> to put the final cap on this object! leaving the buffer like this :
    <pre><code class="language-json">{"k":1,"Object":{}}</code></pre>

    We can now pass this buffer out or even write it out to a file.
